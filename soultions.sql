-- 5 Business Problems

-- 1. Count the number of Movies vs TV Shows

SELECT 
	type, 
	COUNT(*) as total_content
FROM netflix 
GROUP BY type

2. Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows

SELECT
	type,
	rating
FROM
(
	SELECT 
		type,
		rating,
		COUNT(*),
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as ranking
	FROM netflix
	GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE 
	ranking=1

3. List all movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)

 --filter 2020
 --movies

SELECT * FROM netflix
WHERE 
	type= 'Movie'
	AND
	release_year=2020


4. Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix


SELECT 
	UNNEST (STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')) as new_country,
	COUNT(show_id) as total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5


5. List all movies that are documentaries

SELECT * FROM netflix
WHERE
	listed_in ILIKE '%documentaries%'
